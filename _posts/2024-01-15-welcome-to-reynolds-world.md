Welcome to the Reynolds World theme! This is a sample post to demonstrate how
your content will look when using this theme.

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and
re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many
different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which
launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the
convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front
matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it
works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Reynolds World')
#=> prints 'Hi, Reynolds World' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
